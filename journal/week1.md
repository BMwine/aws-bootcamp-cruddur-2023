- Write a Dockerfile for each app

## Homework Challenges    

- Push and tag a image to DockerHub (they have a free tier)
- Use multi-stage building for a Dockerfile build
- Implement a healthcheck in the V3 Docker compose file
- Research best practices of Dockerfiles and attempt to implement it in your Dockerfile
- Learn how to install Docker on your localmachine and get the same containers running outside of Gitpod / Codespaces
- Launch an EC2 instance that has docker installed, and pull a container to demonstrate you can run your own docker processes.
