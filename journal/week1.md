### Technical Tasks Completed:

1. Containerized the backend app




Week 1 — Docker and App Containerization

Technical Tasks
In this class, we are going to:
Create a new GitHub repo
Launch the repo within a Gitpod workspace
Configure Gitpod.yml configuration, eg. VSCode Extensions
Clone the frontend and backend repo
Explore the codebases
Ensure we can get the apps running locally
Write a Dockerfile for each app
Ensure we get the apps running via individual container
Create a docker-compose file
Ensure we can orchestrate multiple containers to run side by side
Mount directories so we can make changes while we code

Business Scenario
Your company has received the code repositories for the demo application from the contracted web-development firm. The company wants you to investigate the codebases, and ensure you can get them running.

The fractional CTO has suggested we first begin containerizing the applications for both developer and production use, and their reasons stayed why:
To avoid lack of documentation of application and OS configuration
To ensure the effort of application and OS configuration is factored in before investing lots of feature development
If we decide to hire our technical team members we can quickly replicate these environments in any preferred choice.

The fractional CTO has asked that everything be developed in Gitpod, (a Cloud Developer Environment). This will allow the CTO at a press of a button launch the developer environment in a clean state to help with any tricky or emergency implementations, and ensure developer accountability.

Gitpod was since it supports multiple Version Control Services (VCS).. The company has invested considerable effort already in Atlassian JIRA working with the web-dev firm, and repo’s highly likely might be moved to Atlassian BitBucket to take advantage of better integrations within the Atlassian’s ecosystem. 

Weekly Outcome
Gain practical knowledge working with common docker command and running container images for the purpose of local development
Gain practical knowledge of working within a Cloud Development environment
Be able to navigate a backend and front web-application and generally understand how they work

 Homework Challenges    
Run the dockerfile CMD as an external script
Push and tag a image to DockerHub (they have a free tier)
Use multi-stage building for a Dockerfile build
Implement a healthcheck in the V3 Docker compose file
Research best practices of Dockerfiles and attempt to implement it in your Dockerfile
Learn how to install Docker on your localmachine and get the same containers running outside of Gitpod / Codespaces
Launch an EC2 instance that has docker installed, and pull a container to demonstrate you can run your own docker processes.
